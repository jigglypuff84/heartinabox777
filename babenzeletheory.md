Hipsterism as the socio-cultural result of dopamine-disregulation and extension of the liberal arts ethic/aesthetic. 
Characterized by communal living based on shared dietary and lifestyle associated values. 

early childhood development of shoulder girdle due to patterned kinesthetic stimulation combined with the breath holding of "big arms/large breath" swimming. 
Resulting in the tendency towards overdevelopment of the trapezius/rhomboids complex as a holding pattern and hyper extension of the tricep, external rotators of the shoulder, latissimus dorsi, and ceratus anterior. 
Concurrent shortening of the levators (lateral forearm, bicep and medial deltoid). 
Characterized by distended abdomen as a result of increased oxygen demand and diminished upper thoracic expansion leading to diaphragmatic expansion into the lower abdomen. 
As a result pectoral development lags and hypertrophy persists into later years by the mechanism of patterned metabolic demand and optimization of energy resources at the cellular level within relevant tissues. 

language expression developed from the communal breathing exercises of ecstatic singing and dance. 
phonemes abstract from rhythmic concepts giving a basis for which complex polyrhythmic expression may cohere into predictable proto-linguistic forms. (saxophone hindewhu) 
syllabic representation of percussion tones takes on near universal relevance as the basis for representational cognition of rhythm. (Wondo) 
predictable rhythmic frameworks scaffold syncopated vocal phrases which cofunction as combinatorial elements mirroring the theme/variation patterns of "purely" percussive "voices" (accented claps, djembe). 
These phenomena extend from the endemic nature of neurological basal patterning which reflect the reward/expectation nature of autonomic processes involved in respiration and kinesthetic motor chains (breathing, walking, running, chewing). 
Rhythmic tonal morphemes developed and transmitted during ecstatic states are then transmuted into vocal expression during non-ecstatic normal eudaemonic breathing states.
