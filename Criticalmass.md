“There’s no resting on the go with a fixed gear bike” said the snotty tattoo laden young adult. 
“I use mine to irk motorists and show the world what a wondrous and valiant soul is contained within my corpus”, he added. These types of one-way conversations had proliferated in resent times following the new flood of fixed gear bike hysteria. 
Across the globe young jackasses everywhere had begun building underperforming/primitive bicycles in order to impress the ladies or just to stick a finger to the proverbial “man”. 
This sort of assholery had persisted despite numerous police crackdowns on critical mass rides in which hordes of angry youths block traffic on their old ass bikes. 
Bloomberg sought to reign in the problem and sent his legions of hog mounted dragoons to lasso the rancorous plebes into submission. 
But the hogs grew weary and rummaged through vast mountains of sidewalk trash as the dragoons were forced to hoof it back to base for it was not in their contract to do battle so dismounted.  
“Silence ye counterculture hooligans!” sounded the chief of police over his megaphone. 
The arbiter of peace and justice himself Barjack Ojama bin stalin Soterovich flew in from Das capital of da USA and wielded his mighty scepter like his predecessor Gandalf had once when defending the fellowship from the flaming Balrog of the Mines of Moria. 
“Contrary to popular belief”, began the wizened elf prince “I am not responsible for this mountain of colic that resides in each of your youthened throats!” 
White apostles from the Church of the Cismale-heteroPatriarchy, cast their spells of enchantment to ward off the traffic blocking keen cyclists to no avail. 
They had each of them traveled five gallons of moonshine jalopy juice worth of distance at the behest of President Barjack, Lord of the underfed. 
They had once occupied remote loci within the depths of rural America and had in their time there taken an oath to ascetic practice, homebrewing and spousal abuse. 
Their Wives, all but dead for those who had entered the priesthood of Cismale-heteroPatriarchy by smoke signal correspondence, had withered away on a constant diet of uncooked frozen burritos, road kill and booze. 
The youths seemed undeterred and advanced their ranks with garbage pail lid shields, teeth clenched, lip-rings askew. 
“Oooowah!” shouted the angry urbanites. 
Great jousting poles of PVC had been fashioned out of old plumbumming, which was once the carrier of the water fluid that was the life’s blood of their rent controlled hovels. 
Atop each lance there was fashioned a skewered teddy bear for the sake of which the children who watched mouths agape whimpered and crooned for they knew the proper treatment of such inanimate ursine effigies. 
The bus driver removed his cap and wiped his brow from which dripped a single bead of metabolic waste. 
His wheeled rectangle had been lodged without motion for some time and without the benefit of air conditioning but that of the swampy Nuevo Yorkian summer’s afternoon. 
One of the Foreign exchange police from Brystol, named Bobby, removed his club and charged forth to engage the raucous knuckle-tattoo wielders. 
“back yer, ungreatfull arses back to Billiesburg you horn handed bikebeaters!” 
Lord Barjack looked on in shame for he new that such straight shooting might only bring an end to the conflict at hand. 
His very sincere position in favor of never-ending brinkmanship had been offended and one of his priestly aides had there drafted a strongly worded letter at the ready. 
Bobby the bobby from Brystol charged on despite the disapproval of Lord Barjack and made contact with the first ham-fisted butch that kept the fun between her legs limited to intermittent escapades on her steel steed and frequent gatherings of bicycle co-operative lesbeaux night orgies. 
She preferred non-gendered pronouns and ze gripped zer bar-steerer, as Ze called it in a clear act of defiance to the bicyco-mechanico-patriarchy which had kept her down since High school gym class in which she was banned from the locker room for her cunning rape attempts at her classmates’ cunts. 
“Christ, I love munching poon!” 
she stammered in apparent shuddering lust for her bike krew commie patriots. 
Bobby struck zer with brutal force fitting for not to restore the sense that had once lain therein but to render pleasure. 
Teeth erupted from her fat rotund face and her daisy duke cutoffs grew damp with vaginal mucous as Ze was a masochist. 
“Fuck you Brit, Bobby Cop” she gummed whilst blood oozed from her indignant gullet. 
“That’s a hate crime” she gurgled. 
But Bobby had turned to zer left and had swung his billy club at another messenger-bag toting gutter-punk. 
Enormous Mohawk spikes that jutted from the wearer of the canvas sling-purse parried his blow and Bobby spun around to trample the spokes of many a fair-trade coffee enthusiast. 
“That’s not nice!” pleaded the labor organizer for a progressive organic pickle cannery who had a penchant for rising inflection and had trouble giving proper tone to match the whining sincerity of his glottal sonorities. 
“I make Facebook groups for a living!” 
he chimed cheerfully as he too fell prey to Billie’s Bludgeoning. 
By now a group of meta-cool pneu-wavers had started back into apathy at the boredom inherent in things that had been done before. 
They all stripped naked and proceeded to draw on butcher paper with rectally clenched shit-logs. 
The resultant miasma of hipster filth flooded the crowd and it dispersed much to the dismay of many a dedicated anarchist. 
The following day Lord Barjack giver of hope, christened the third Friday of the month Fecal Art Day in commemoration of those unwitting trend chasers “who had the strength and resolve to ruin the roadblock with their peaceful pinching of poop”. 
The heroes responded with an indifferent “meh…” and went on to use their newly awarded national endowment for the arts grant on bespoke woodsmen axes and secondhand flannel. 
streets of Angarak.

“Do you lads mean to take us on?!

Do you have a bloody clue what you are saying or are you just playing to your people?”  He questioned the masked profanators of space and time.

When they replied in an undefined of unintelligible mumbling and incoherent bleating his scepter struck a flexible steel rod against the reinforced floor creating a fracture in the outline of the doorway.

“Oof!

That hurt!

Get back out the way or you will be next!” he admonished.

Jinglehoke finally made his way through the fallen statue of  the mayor of Washington D.C. and shuffled his way
