 ... do you know that quote i wrote, "Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll sit in the damn water for a day just SCREAMING, FUCKING SHIT AT ANY PICNIC BUT US. MAKE IT THE RIGHT FUCKING PICNIC. Fucker." i still LOVE that quote.

why is the only one that got waterfalled so stupid with it? are they NUTS? i can't believe you gave a man a fish and he's sitting in the goddamn lake crying into his goddamn fish over his goddamn failure.

DOES ANY OF THIS EVEN MAKE SENSE??

i don't know what to do. if you keep ignoring me and being so fucking easygoing about everything, i might have to do something drastic... it's not right for me to have to be yelling at you.

if you would maybe consider apologizioun a little and take some responsibility for what happened i would greatly appreciate it and i would make up for it.

thanks, goodbye, and take care (and, a little bit, by "take care" i mean "fuck yourself in the face so hard that you suck on the after-taste until you get diarrhea for a week").

i hope your head explodes (this post deserves a good head explosion)

my copy of the omni has gone missing in action and i need my magic power back.

i'm trying to write up a song, but i'm gonna have to stop and scream like a little girl.
