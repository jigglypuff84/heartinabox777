3. Modular expression grammars

Compile expressions together as well as separate them with semicolons:

1 if 2 3 if 4

1 2 if 3 4 if

compile('1 2 3) { foo | foo & } foo +++

It also means writing expressions together like this:

1 2 foo + foo + 3

If you combine expressions like this, they’ll all be compiled and then will be able to be used like a bunch of functions, rather than separate functions.

Now that we’ve gotten a general idea of how these operations work, we’ll start exploring the syntax and how to work with them.

Let’s look at some of the ways you’ll be able to build macros with
